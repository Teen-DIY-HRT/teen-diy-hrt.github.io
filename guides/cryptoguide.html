                <div>
                    <p> 
                        As you've noticed, most HRT sites only utilize cryptocurrency as payment methods.
                        This sucks, I know, because it's a significantly more obsecure payment method versus just using your credit card.
                        It's inconvenient and new to our minds but trust me, it's easier than you'd initially think.
                        Sites like these only use crypto because it keeps their identity secret and keeps our transaction private.
                        <br><br>
                        Before we start purchasing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, we must first make a Bitcoin wallet.
                        I suggest using <a href="https://www.exodus.com/download/">Exodus wallet</a> for this, primarily because it's a really simple wallet.
                        The only downside is that it's not open source.
                        Now note that making crypto wallets NEVER cost money, they're all free.
                        <br><br>
                        Now that you've made your Bitcoin wallet you can now start purchasing some Bitcoin.
                        Before you do, please read this guide on how Bitcoin addresses works. 
                        <br><br>
                        There are 2 methods to buying Bitcoin independently as a minor.
                        Due to KYC (Know your Customer) practices, online crypto exchanges prevent minors from purchasing cryptocurrency.
                        KYC exchanges tend ask for Social Security Number (SSN) or other forms of identification like drivers license.
                        Which is why you must do it through non-KYC methods I'll be addressing each in their respective headers...
                    </p>
                    <h3>Crypto ATMs</h3>
                    <p>
                        I recommend this method the most for its straight forwardness.
                        You can utilize cash as a payment method, some allow for cards.
                        Watch this video to get a grasp on how to use one
                        <br><br>
                        Using a crypto ATM is the safest method but the least convenient since you have to travel to an ATM which can be several miles away.
                        Another reason is the fees, Crypto ATMs tend to have large fees ranging all the way to 25% of the deposited balance.
                        A major pro for some would be that you only need cash, no debit or credit cards are necessary.
                        I suggest doing research on fees or calculate the amount of crypto you'll be obtaining before completing the ATM exchange.
                        As some ATMs will try to be sneaky about the hidden fees.
                    </p>

                    <h3>P2P Exchange</h3>
                    <p>
                        This method is the most riskiest because there's a chance of getting scammed if you are not careful with who you trade with.
                        Proceed with caution and don't fall into your desperation.
                        Of course this one can be done online and has no need for travel.
                        <br><br>
                        P2P Exchange in full stands for Peer-to-Peer Exchange, its the practice of directly exchanging money to/from cryptocurrency.
                        It can be done with friends, parents, trusted exchangers on the several P2P platforms.
                        <br><br>
                        The reccomended P2P sources are <a href="https://localcoinswap.com/">LocalCoinSwap</a> and <a href="https://bitpapa.com/">BitPapa</a>,
                        you won't be able to get scammed on these sites since these platforms utilize Escrow.
                        Escrow in this context is basically an automated middleman to refund the transaction if fraud is detected.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Paybis</h3>
                    <p>

                        Now that you've bought the Bitcoin,
                        you can now buy your Hormones from the sources listed in their respective guides.
