                    <p>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a>
                        is a digital currency, it does not rely on any banks, governments or other authority figures to regulate it.
                        Which is why we use it, <mark>if you make a purchase it's completely private and untraceable.</mark>
                        Since cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, most HRT sites only utilize cryptocurrency as payment methods.
                        This sucks, I know, because it's a significantly more obscure payment method versus just using your credit card.
                        It's new to our minds but trust me, it's easier than you'd initially think.
                        Just remember we only have to use it because it keeps their identity secret but ours too.
                        That is, if you don't expose your public address on social media and tell other people about your purchases!
                        <br><br>
                        Another major advantage is that since we make purchases with crypto they can't be intercepted or found out by our parents.

                        The primary cryptocurrency I'll be discussing in this guide is
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to ever been made.</a>
                        So I'll be referring to bitcoin throughout the rest of this guide.

                        Below I'll be listing <b>three methods</b> on how to obtain Bitcoin, but first you have to learn about
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer (KYC) policies.</a>
                        KYC is a term used to describe the practice of verifying someone's identity.
                        The most common methods are providing Social Security Numbers (SSN), driver licenses, home addresses and legal names.
                        Buying Bitcoin is hard exactly for this reason, <mark>exchangers prohibit teenagers from purchasing from their sites by doing KYC.</mark>
                        <br><br>
                        Because of Know Your Customer policies, I put in a lot of effort and research into finding methods on buying Bitcoin which would bypass this.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        When you make a bitcoin wallet you have two addresses,
                        <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/academy/en/lessons/what-are-public-keys-private-keys-and-wallet-addresses/">the public address and the private address.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        Think of your public address as the <mark>Paypal username your family and friends would send money to.</mark><br>
                        Think of your private address as the <mark>Paypal password you use to login.</mark><br><br>
                        When creating a bitcoin wallet, you won't typically be seeing your private address as there are more robust and secure methods to signing into nowadays.
                        The public address is what matters the most, as that's what you'll be using to buy bitcoin into and send bitcoin out of.
                        <br><br>
                        So just like how your public address is your Paypal username, other people have usernames too.
                        So when purchasing estrogen or testosterone, simply send the bitcoin to their public address.
                        <b>Never give anyone other information besides your public address.</b>
                        Since that'd give them access to your wallet.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bitcoin Wallet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now it's time for you to download your bitcoin wallet, I personally recommend the
                        <a href="https://www.exodus.com/download">Exodus Crypto wallet.</a>
                        There's no signing in or verifying your identity.
                        It also supports other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin!
                        So this wallet is also good for general usage.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you download the wallet, you'll see a button that says <b>"receive."</b>
                        Press that button and you will see your public address accompanied with a QR code.
                        You can also use that QR code in the future if you decide to buy bitcoin with a physical ATM.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's the blockchain?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's also worth mentioning there's something called the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain.</a>
                        The blockchain is a wide scale list of all the transactions to ever have occurred on the bitcoin network.
                        Using the blockchain, you can search a wallet's historical transactions.
                        This is just something I thought would be valuable to mention.
                        <br><br>
                        There are several sites where you can view the blockchain, here are some below.

                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXXPuHRBhB8">Above is a video on how to use a Bitcoin ATM,</a>
                        also known as a BTM, they are exactly what the name says!
                        You can convert cash to bitcoin and vice versa. 
                        Bitcoin machines are a great way to buy bitcoin without the presence of KYC policies.
                        Especially for individuals without access to online purchasing.
                        <br><br>
                        When going up to a Bitcoin ATM you deposit physical money in exchange for Bitcoin.
                        This makes ATMs the most viable option for those who do not have bank accounts.
                        Although there are drawbacks to BTMs, they tend to have large fees and require distanced travel.
                        Meaning a chunk of balance may be taken from the final result as a fee for using the BTM,
                        this can <mark>range from as little as 5% to 25%.</mark>
                        As for the travel, BTMs are usually located in grocery stores or gas stations.
                        Some times being miles away or in another adjacent city from yours, this is the drawback.
                        <br><br>
                        So before going to a Bitcoin ATM, make sure you consider the fee deductions and the method of traveling you'll use.
                        I suggest doing research on calculating the amount of bitcoin you'll be obtaining before exchanging anything.
                        <a href="https://archive.is/sH9Zt">You can use this tool to calculate BTM fees before purchasing.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        Below I provided a number of BTM finders along with the fee range.<br>
                        <mark><b>Some BTMs on the Global Bitcoin ATM Map may require KYC, please check before travelling.</b></mark>

                        are businesses that allow customers to trade bitcoin in exchange for money and vice versa.
                        This is the more common and traditional method to purchasing cryptocurrency.
                        Though an overwhelming majority of these businesses practice KYC and do not accept teens utilizing their services.
                        <br><br>
                        However there are a few exceptions, below I'll be listing their sites and writing a special section on an exchange called

                    <h3>How to use Paybis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Paybis is a general cryptocurrency exchange.
                        They have a mechanism called <a href="https://paybis.com/blog/seamless-transactions-skip-the-kyc/">"On/Off Ramp,"</a>
                        this feature has it so an individual can only purchase bitcoin without KYC on the first purchase.
                        The rest of the purchases will have KYC.
                        <mark>So please be considerate and try buying as much bitcoin as you can on the first payment,
                        because any purchases you will try to make in the future will ask you for your ID.</mark>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/what-are-peer-to-peer-transactions/">P2P stands for Peer-to-Peer,</a>
                        used to describe when one person directly interacts with another person.
                        In the context of bitcoin exchange however, it's called Peer-to-Peer purchasing/trading.
                        Used to describe the practice of giving money to another person in exchange for bitcoin,
                        this can be switched around as you can also exchange bitcoin for money instead.
                        This is different from how you'd typically purchase bitcoin, usually it's bought from exchanges or vendors.
                        We avoid this because they typically have KYC instated into their terms of service.
                        Which is why we use P2P instead.
                        <br><br>
                        Peer-to-Peer purchasing has only one drawback,
                        <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/p2p/understanding-the-risks-of-offexchange-p2p-trading-346915784116718390">there is a risk of getting scammed if you are not careful.</a>
                        You could agree to trading with someone and give them money, they could simply not give the bitcoin to you.
                        To avoid this,
                        <a href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/what-is-bitcoin-escrow/">use sites with an escrow middleman.</a>
                        Escrow refers to a process where a trusted third party temporarily holds funds during a transaction between two parties.
                        So if it detects an attempt at a scam or a fraud it will stop the transaction and refund your money.
                        <br><br>
                        Below I listed some P2P platforms you can use without KYC.
                        All of these platforms utilize escrow to prevent scams.
