                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen">Estrogen</a>
                        is a category of sex hormones that are responsible for the maintenance and <mark>development of female characteristics,</mark>
                        posing vital roles in female puberty and female sexual reproduction.
                        Estradiol also called E2 for short, is the most potent form of estrogen.
                        Throughout this guide you'll see me using it interchangeably with estrogen.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the typical female characteristics estrogen is known to promote are
                        bigger hips, breasts, decreased muscle mass, decreased height and overall lack of body hair and softer skin.
                        Though estrogen production occurs in both men and women alike, playing significant roles in our biology and health.
                        Women just typically have more significantly more estrogen while men have less.
                        <br><br>
                        When someone has female ranges of Estrogen, they'll develop the female dimorphic features listed above.
                        Beginning to <mark>look and sound like the other women</mark> they see within their family.
                        You see the occurrence of this starting in a girl's puberty, she'll develop breasts and sound more feminine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you do 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-affirming_hormone_therapy">hormone replacement therapy</a>
                        with Estrogen you can expect to develop these bodily effects above.
                        A rough timelapse where you can expect these changes is provided, but of course this very much varies upon age and dosage.
                        Please note that Estrogen's effectiveness is increased if you take it before or during your male puberty.
                        After your male puberty is done, <mark>no bone-changing altercations will occur.</mark>
                        This is due to the fact Estrogen is not as potent as Testosterone
                        and can't reverse the bone created during your puberty nor can it build bone.
                        <br><br>
                        You will not experience any feminization of the voice, or rather obtain any typical
                        female skeleton characteristics if you have finished male puberty (Tanner 5) and your bones have fused.
                        <mark>You will still obtain some female characteristics though,</mark> like fattier thighs and breasts.

                        If you're questioning if you should do HRT, your first concern may be if it's dangerous.
                        <mark>Short answer, no.</mark>
                        <br><br>
                        It's not dangerous but as with all medical procedures, there are risks.
                        Though the chances of <mark>adverse effects actually occurring is extremely low.</mark>
                        Especially if you manage your dosage wisely.
                        In fact, HRT and exogenous hormones are taken by over a hundred million women globally.
                        Which goes to show how possible safe administration is.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Risks observable with patients taking Estrogen</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VTE/Clotting (DVT, Stroke, Pulmonary Embolism, etc)</li>

                    <p id="Marker">
                        These risks depend highly on the method of estrogen taken (ex. pills)<br>
                        These risks are common amongst every person with female estrogen levels
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Overdose Risks</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you happen to take too much estrogen, it's generally fine.
                            Women during their menstrual cycle actually can peak all the way up to 550-750 pg/mL of Estradiol Mid-cycle.
                            This is about 3x times above the female estrogen median.
                            <br><br>
                            But staying at prolonged high estrogen levels generally is never good.
                            So try not to mess up your doses.
                            Just know, the health consequences are minimal.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Underdose Risks</h4>
                        <p>
                            Regardless of tanner stage or age.
                            If you take too little estrogen, you will not receive full feminization effects and will partially go through male puberty.
                            Though if you utilize anti-androgens which are mentioned furthermore below.
                            You will not continue masculinizing so there is a lower consequence if you end up underdosing yourself.
                            <br><br>
                            To prevent this from occurring, use the recommended dosages.

                    <p>
                        Hormonal therapy for transgender girls has many complicated nuances.
                        For example, <mark>trans girls typically have to take 2 medicines instead of one,</mark> estrogen and anti-androgens.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiandrogen">Anti-androgens also known as anti-testosterones,</a>
                        are incorporated because many trans women don't reach high enough estrogen levels to suppress their testosterone.
                        <br><br>
                        <mark><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/monotherapy">Monotherapy</a>
                        is the term for this, when you use only one medicine</mark> to treat a condition.
                        Monotherapy can only be practiced when a trans girl decides to inject her estrogen.
                        Other methods of administration like pills, patches or gel aren't strong enough on it's own to suppress testosterone.
                        Which like I said earlier, is why we need anti-androgens.
                        <br><br>
                        You can also use a hormone called progesterone, which will <mark>help breast growth after you've been on HRT</mark> for at least two years.
                        I discuss more about this below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Anti-Androgens</h2>
                    <p>
                        For anti-androgens, you can use the following 3 medicines.
                        Bicalutamide, Cyproterone Acetate or Spironolactone.
                        When you use these medications in combination with estrogen, <mark>it enhances the anti-androgen's effects.</mark>
                        <br><br>
                        Heads up, this is going kinda deep into mechanism of action so this may be confusing to you.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Cyproterone Acetate</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyproterone_acetate">Cyproterone</a>
                            is an anti-androgen that stops the production of testosterone so you no longer masculinize.
                            It works by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis">inhibiting the release of GnRH</a>
                            and inhibiting testosterone and
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone">dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</a> from interacting with the androgen receptors.
                            So not only does the testosterone in your body decrease, it also prevents the testosterone producing any effects.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Cyproterone is the most recommended anti-androgen,</mark> despite being 2nd most effective on this list.
                            We recommend Cyproterone because it's an affordable,

                            unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicalutamide">Bicalutamide</a>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Bicalutamide</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicalutamide">Bicalutamide</a>
                            is an anti-androgen that stops the effects of testosterone.
                            It doesn't stop the production of it, but it stops the effects.
                            So you won't masculinize but you'll still have male ranges of testosterone in your body.
                            This is because Bicalutamide is a SARM that works by selectively inhibiting testosterones from interacting with the androgen receptors.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Bicalutamide is the 2nd most recommended anti-androgen,</mark> it's more effective than Cyproterone though.
                            It's expensive but at the end of the day, it does it's job as an anti-androgen.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Spironolactone</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spironolactone">Spironolactone</a>
                            is a weak anti-androgen that stops the production of testosterone.
                            It's more likely to produce better effects in early tanner-stage trans girls.
                            This is because in younger girls their testes aren't as fully developed,
                            thus their body doesn't produce as much testosterone.
                            The biggest and only pro about Spironolactone is that it's low-risk in terms of adverse effects.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Spironolactone is the 3rd most recommended anti-androgen</mark> and the 3rd most effective,
                            because of it's low effectiveness and high interindividual variability.
                            It's slightly expensive but if you can, buy Cyproterone or Bicalutamide if you can.
                            There's no reason to buy Spironolactone if you can buy the other two.

                    <p>
                        I'll be listing two forms of obtaining estrogen, injections and pills.
                        <br><br>
                        I will also be listing other forms of obtaining estrogen like gel, patches, sprays and droppers <mark>but I do not suggest their usage in any capacity.</mark>
                        These methods are not recommended usually do their their ineffectiveness, lack of formal research or expensiveness. 
                        Thus, my lack of confidence on recommending them.
                        <br><br>
                        If you decide to use other forms of estrogen not recommended on this guide,
                        please join the matrix server or email me for guidance. DIY safely!
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Injections</h4>
                        <p>
                            <mark>90$ - 130$ biyearly for Vials<br></mark>
                            <mark>20$ - 30$ biyearly for Supplies<br></mark>
                            Doing the math, you only pay about 135$ on median every 2 years.
                            <br><br>
                            For injections, you can administer this in two ways.
                            Monotherapy or non-monotherapy, which would be with anti-androgens.
                            This is a major pro because this makes injections the most cost-effective method.
                            Not to mention, it's the most effective method of administering HRT because of it's high potency.
                            You usually only have to do an injection once every 7 days or 14 days.
                            Of course this depends on the type of ester/formulation of estrogen you buy.
                            <br><br>
                            For injections, there are several <mark>different types of estradiol formulations you can purchase.</mark>
                            For example, there is estradiol valerate, estradiol enanthate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol undecylate, estradiol benzoate and much more.
                            You may be wondering now which one you should buy then.
                            <mark>I recommend estradiol enanthate, estradiol cypionate or estradiol undecylate only.</mark>
                            This is because you won't have to inject as often if you were take an ester like valerate or benzoate.
                            <br><br>
                            Injections for these reasons above make this the most recommended form of administering estrogen.
                            It's the most convenient, cost effective and potent.
                            Obviously, the biggest downside being you have to use needles.
                            This is a common fear for many, so if you think this is too much of a drawback, try the method below.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Pills</h4>
                        <p>
                            <mark>80$ - 150$ yearly for Anti-Androgens<br></mark>
                            <mark>160$ - 190$ yearly for Regular Estradiol Pills<br></mark>
                            <mark>240$ - 320$ yearly for Estradiol Valerate Pills<br></mark>
                            Disregarding pill types, you should pay around 290$ every year.
                            <br><br>
                            For pills, you must take it with anti-androgens and you must take several tablets throughout the day.
                            This is because pills have low bioavailability,
                            thus can't reach high enough estrogen levels to suppress endogenous testosterone alone. 
                            <br><br>
                            There are also 2 types of estrogen pills, the regular kind (Hemihydrate) and the less potent kind (Valerate)
                            <br>
                            This is vital information to know, not all estrogen pills are created equally in effectiveness.
                            If you buy valerate estrogen pills,
                            you will have to buy more since they're less effective than hemihydrate estrogen pills.
                            Make sure to keep this in mind...
                            <br><br>
                            Pills for these reasons above make this the 2nd most recommended form of administering estrogen.
                            It's expensive but overall an effective alternative to injections.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <hr>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            I do not recommend the following forms of estrogen listed below.
                            There will be no price ranges or sources for their obtainment.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Gel</h4>
                        <p>
                            Gel is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal">transdermal method</a> of intaking estrogen.
                            You pump some out of a bottle and apply it onto the skin throughout the day.
                            Typically in areas like the forearm, thigh or in rarer cases, the scrotum.
                            <br><br>
                            It's been shown that scrotal application can increase estradiol levels
                            <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/genital-e2-application/">roughly 5-fold relative to conventional skin sites.</a>
                            While this analysis is done on specifically estradiol patches, it's presumed gel to be able to achieve the same levels.
                            Though gel has even higher varying interindividual levels than patches, being approximately
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics_of_estradiol#Variability_in_pharmacokinetics">11-fold for gel and 7-fold for patches.</a>
                            This makes gel a overall worse candidate than patches in general effectiveness, also a worse candidate for general HRT.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Due to it's lack of effectiveness I cannot recommend this form of estrogen.</mark>
                            Albeit multiple users of transdermal/topical estrogen have reported success, it's hard to guarantee it'll do the same with the absence of testing.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Patches</h4>
                        <p>
                            Patches are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal">transdermal method</a> of intaking estrogen.
                            You apply them onto your skin and switch it out occasionally.
                            Applying it on the same areas you would apply estradiol gel.
                            <br><br>
                            As mentioned above, you can apply patches scrotally to increase estradiol levels
                            <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/genital-e2-application/">roughly 5-fold relative to conventional skin sites.</a>
                            While not clinically praticed, it's a viable method of obtaining higher estrogen levels.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Due to it's lack of effectiveness I cannot recommend this form of estrogen.</mark>
                            Albeit multiple users of transdermal/topical estrogen have reported success, it's hard to guarantee it'll do the same with the absence of testing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Sprays</h4>
                        <p>
                            Sprays are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_medication">topical method</a> of intaking estrogen.
                            You apply it onto areas where skin is thin, thus more absorbent.
                            Areas like the armpits or scrotum are best for this.
                            <br><br>
                            In any capacity, I cannot recommend this this form of estrogen.
                            <mark>It entirely lacks clinical research and the data to showcase it's effectiveness.</mark>
                            Not to mention, the lack of consideration to important factors like penetration enhancers, which would significantly affect the pharmacokinetics.
                            So not only do I know how effective it is, I'm also unaware how much concentration you would need to reach an estradiol goal.
                            <br><br>
                            Please do not utilize sprays and instead buy injections or pills.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Droppers</h4>
                        <p>
                            Droppers are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration">oral method</a> of intaking estrogen.
                            You drop a little bit of the liquid under the tongue and let it dissolve, sublingual method.
                            <br><br>
                            In any capacity, I cannot recommend this this form of estrogen.
                            <mark>It entirely lacks clinical research and the data to showcase it's effectiveness.</mark>
                            I do not know how effective it is, nor have I seen human outcomes to come to a robust conclusion on concentration needed to meet an estradiol goal.
                            <br><br>
                            Please do not utilize droppers and instead buy injections or pills.
