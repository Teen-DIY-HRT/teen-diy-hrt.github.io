                        is a category of sex hormones that are responsible for the maintenance and <mark>development of female characteristics,</mark>
                        posing vital roles in female puberty and female sexual reproduction.
                        Some of the typical female characteristics it's known to promote are
                        bigger hips, breasts, decreased muscle mass, decreased height and overall lack of body hair and softer skin.
                        Though estrogen production occurs in both men and women alike, playing significant roles in our biology and health.
                        Women just typically have more significantly more estrogen while men have less.
                        <br><br>
                        When someone has female ranges of Estrogen, they'll develop the female dimorphic features listed above.
                        Beginning to <mark>look and sound like the other women</mark> they see within their family.
                        You see the occurrence of this starting in a girl's puberty, she'll develop breasts and sound more feminine.

                        with Estrogen you can expect to develop these bodily effects above.
                        A rough timelapse where you can expect these changes is provided, but of course this very much varies upon age and dosage.
                        Please note that Estrogen's effectiveness is increased if you take it before or during your male puberty.
                        After your male puberty is done, <mark>no bone-changing altercations will occur.</mark>
                        This is due to the fact Estrogen is not as potent as Testosterone
                        and can't reverse the bone created during your puberty nor can it build bone.
                        <br><br>
                        You will not experience any feminization of the voice, or rather obtain any typical
                        female skeleton characteristics if you have finished male puberty (Tanner 5) and your bones have fused.
                        <mark>You will still obtain some female characteristics though,</mark> like fattier thighs and breasts.

                        Hormonal therapy for transgender girls has many complicated nuances.
                        For example, <mark>trans girls typically have to take 2 medicines instead of one,</mark> estrogen and anti-androgens.
                        Anti-androgens also known as anti-testosterones, are incorporated because many trans women don't reach high enough estrogen levels to suppress their testosterone.
                        <br><br>
                        <mark>Monotherapy is the term for this, when you use only one medicine</mark> to treat a condition.
                        Monotherapy can only be practiced when a trans girl decides to inject her estrogen.
                        Other methods of administration like pills, patches or gel aren't strong enough on it's own to suppress testosterone.
                        Which like I said earlier, is why we need anti-androgens.
                        <br><br>
                        You can also use a hormone called progesterone, which will <mark>help breast growth after you've been on HRT</mark> for at least a year.
                        I discuss more about this below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Anti-Androgens</h2>
                    <p>
                        For anti-androgens, you can use the following 3 medicines.
                        Bicalutamide, Cyproterone Acetate or Spironolactone.
                        When you use these medications in combination with estrogen, <mark>it enhances the anti-androgen's effects.</mark>
                        <br><br>
                        Heads up, this is going kinda deep into mechanism of action so this may be confusing to you.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Cyproterone Acetate</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cyproterone is an anti-androgen that stops the production of testosterone so you no longer masculinize.
                            It works by inhibiting the release of GnRH and inhibiting testosterone and DHT from interacting with the androgen receptors.
                            So not only does the testosterone in your body decrease, it also prevents the testosterone producing any effects.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Cyproterone is the most recommended anti-androgen,</mark> despite being 2nd most effective on this list.
                            We recommend Cyproterone because it's an affordable,
                            potent anti-androgen that isn't a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) unlike Bicalutamide.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Bicalutamide</h4>
                        <p>
                            Bicalutamide is an anti-androgen that stops the effects of testosterone.
                            It doesn't stop the production of it, but it stops the effects.
                            So you won't masculinize but you'll still have male ranges of testosterone in your body.
                            This is because Bicalutamide is a SARM that works by selectively inhibiting testosterones from interacting with the androgen receptors.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Bicalutamide is the 2nd most recommended anti-androgen,</mark> it's more effective than Cyproterone though.
                            It's expensive but at the end of the day, it does it's job as an anti-androgen.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Spironolactone</h4>
                        <p>
                            Spironolactone is a weak anti-androgen that stops the production of testosterone.
                            It's more likely to produce better effects in early tanner-stage trans girls.
                            This is because in younger girls their testes aren't as fully developed,
                            thus their body doesn't produce as much testosterone.
                            The biggest and only pro about Spironolactone is that it's low-risk in terms of adverse effects.
                            <br><br>
                            <mark>Spironolactone is the 3rd most recommended anti-androgen</mark> and the 3rd most effective,
                            because of it's low effectiveness and high interindividual variability.
                            It's slightly expensive but if you can, buy Cyproterone or Bicalutamide if you can.
                            There's no reason to buy Spironolactone if you can buy the other two.
                        </p>

                        I'll be listing two forms of obtaining estrogen, injections and pills.
                        There are several other estrogen forms but I will not be mentioning them due to their lack of effectiveness.

                            For injections, you can administer this in two ways.
                            Monotherapy or non-monotherapy, which would be with anti-androgens.
                            This is a major pro because this makes injections the most cost-effective method.
                            Not to mention, it's the most effective method of administering HRT because of it's high potency.
                            You usually only have to do an injection once every 7 days or 14 days.
                            <br><br>
                            Injections for these reasons above make this the most recommended form of administering estrogen.
                            It's the most convenient, cost effective and potent.
                            Obviously, the biggest downside being you have to use needles.
                            This is a common fear for many, so if you think this is too much of a drawback, try the method below.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Pills</h4>
                        <p>
                            <mark>80$ - 150$ yearly for Anti-Androgens<br></mark>
                            <mark>160$ - 190$ yearly for Regular Estradiol Pills<br></mark>
                            <mark>240$ - 320$ yearly for Estradiol Valerate Pills<br></mark>
                            Disregarding pill types, you should pay around 290$ every year.
                            <br><br>
                            For pills, you must take it with anti-androgens and you must take several tablets throughout the day.
                            This is because pills have low bioavailability,
                            thus can't reach high enough estrogen levels to suppress endogenous testosterone alone. 
                            <br><br>
                            There are also 2 types of estrogen pills, the regular kind (Hemihydrate) and the less potent kind (Valerate)
                            <br>
                            This is vital information to know, not all estrogen pills are created equally in effectiveness.
                            If you buy valerate estrogen pills,
                            you will have to buy more since they're less effective than hemihydrate estrogen pills.
                            Make sure to keep this in mind...
                            <br><br>
                            Pills for these reasons above make this the 2nd most recommended form of administering estrogen.
                            It's expensive but overall an effective alternative to injections.
