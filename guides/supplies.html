                    <h3>Syringes</h3>
                    <p>
						Syringes are what you'll be using to store and push in the oil.
						As demonstrated in the diagram, the barrel is what you'll pull the oil into.
						The plunger is what you'll press on to inject at the injection site.
						<br><br>
						For syringes, you should buy a <b>1ml</b> syringe.
						Make sure to not buy any "oral syringes."
						<br><br>
						You can buy either the <a href="https://www.air-tite-shop.com/Articles/luer-lock-vs-luer-slip-syringes">Luer Lock or Luer Slip syringes</a>,
						these are the 2 types of syringes you can buy.
						As referenced in their names, the Luer Lock syringes locks the needle in place, so you can't remove the needle after you attach it.
						Meanwhile, the Luer Slip syringes allows you to attach and deattach the needle, allowing you to remove the needle after you've attached it.
						That's the only difference between these two categories, depends merely on preference.
						<br><br>
						Either way, I made a list of sources you can buy Syringes from so you don't mess up.
						Links from Amazon are included, so this purchase should be easier compared to buying bitcoin.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Injection Needles</h3>
                    <p>
						Here we have Injection Needles, this is what you'll be using to actually draw up the oil and inject it.
						You'll slip the needle onto the syringe's tip to then proceed into injecting.
						<br><br>
						For needles, you should buy a <b>1 inch, 25 gauge</b> needle.
						I made a list of sources you can buy from below.

                    <h3>Alcohol Pads</h3>
                    <p>
						Alcohol Pads are what you'll be using to sanitize the area you'll be injecting at.
						You rub the pad on the injection site, typically your thigh, then you inject at that area.
						<br><br>
						The pads typically come in packs, in large bundles.
						So don't worry about running out of these soon.
						I made a list of sources you can buy from below.

                    <h3>Band-Aids (optional)</h3>
                    <p>
						Buying band-aids are optional, but I still included them because bleeding may occur and it's useful to have these around just in case.
						To avoid bleeding though, simply apply pressure for 10 seconds onto the spot where you injected after completing your injection.
						You can do the same trick to avoid oil leaking.

                    <h3>Sharps Container (optional)</h3>
                    <p>
						<a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safely-using-sharps-needles-and-syringes-home-work-and-travel/sharps-disposal-containers">Sharps Containers</a>
						are where you can store used needles and syringes after you're done injecting.
						These are also called bio-hazard bins and specially created in safely deposing biohazardous waste.
						If you don't want to buy a sharps container, you can utilize a simple plastic tupperware container or other alternatives here to store the waste.
						<br><br>
						To depose of sharp containers, you can throw it away in your
						<a href="https://safeneedledisposal.org/state-search/">household trashcan or garbage bin.</a>
						Please do not recycle, just throw it away in the regular trash.
						<br><br>
						Even then, I still made a list of sources you can buy sharps containers from.
                    </p>
