						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">Testosterone</a>
						is a sex hormone that's responsible for the <mark>maintenance and development of male characteristics,</mark> playing a key part in male puberty and male sexual reproduction.
						Some of the typical male characteristics it's known to promote are increased muscle/bone mass, deeper voice, body hair, facial hair and broader upper torso.
						This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virilization">Virilization</a> which is also better known as Masculinization.
						Though testosterone production occurs in both men and women alike, playing significant roles in our biology and health.
						Men just typically have more testosterone while women have less.
						<br><br>
						When someone has male ranges of Testosterone, they'll develop the male dimorphic features listed above.
						<mark>Beginning to look and sound like the other men</mark> they see within their family.
						You see the occurrence of this starting in a boy's puberty, he'll get taller and stronger.

					<p>
						When you do

						with Testosterone you can expect to develop these bodily effects below.
						A rough timelapse where you can expect these changes is provided, but of course this very much varies upon age and dosage.
						Please note that Testosterone's effectiveness is increased if you take it before or during your female puberty.
						After your female puberty is done, <mark>most of the bone-changing altercations will not occur.</mark>
						Height increase, bigger hands, Masculinization of the skull and bigger ribcage for example will not happen if you have finished female puberty (Tanner 5) and your bones have fused.

					<p>
						When it comes to doing at-home HRT, there is increased risks since most adolescent DIYers don't have access to hormonal testing.
						We can't tell if our levels are in acceptable ranges for our age.
						This is why we rely on determining from our symptoms and side effects if we're in acceptable zones.
						Despite this drawback, we're still able to go about HRT without reporting side effects.
						Below, I wrote the potential risks to doing HRT and what to do if adverse symptoms are showcased.
						<br><br>
						If you have a few bucks to spend, go to this page to do at-home hormonal testing instead.
					</p>
					<h3>Overdose Side Effects</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							If you take too much testosterone these adverse effects may occur. For safety measures, stay in the acceptable range for your age group as shown below.
							I recommend joining the matrix server to receieve additional HRT support, you are welcomed and you are heard.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Underdose Side Effects</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Regardless of tanner stage or age. If you take too little testosterone, you will not receive full masculinization effects and might not achieve estrogen suppression.
							So you will continue feminizing and going partially through your female puberty.
							To maximize effectiveness, stay close to the recommended dosage for your age group to make sure you don't continue going through female puberty.

						This is a video from Nurse Scott,
						he explains how to do intramuscular injections incredibly well and how to <mark>mininize the pain and stress.</mark>
						The video is about 10 minutes but try to watch the entirty because he really does an incredible job!
						<br><br>
						When I first did my injection, I was nervous and afraid I'd do something wrong.
						I didn't put the entire needle in and some of the testosterone oil leaked out.
						After the more injections I did and as I gradually developed a routine, it all became something of great quick ease.
						I can now do my injections in <mark>less than 5 minutes without feeling pain.</mark>
						<br><br>
						So if you mess up the first one, it's fine.
						It's the fact that you're trying and the fact that you took such a large jump to get yourself the medical care you need.
						<mark>You'll improve and everything will be worth i</mark>t once you notice yourself masculinizing.
					</p>

					<h3>Injection Supplies</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Injection supplies are <mark><a href="supplies.html">listed here in this guide.</a></mark>
							Please read the Injection Risks below and stick with buying the needles/syringes from the guide on this site.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Injection Risks</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							I'm using Trans Harm Reduction's guides and resources to relay the risks to wrongfully doing injections.
							There are a few risks to doing intramuscular injections,
							although they are nothing to be worried about if you learn how to avoid them.
						</p>
						<h4>Vial Contamination/Coring</h4>
						<p>
							<a href="https://transharmreduction.org/vial-contamination">Vial Coring</a>
							is a form of <mark>Vial Contamination</mark> that occurs when the rubber seal on a vial is broken or damaged.
							The rubber seal's purpose is to stop contaminants from entering the oil.
							Coring can cause rubber from the seal to break off into the oil, posing a major safety risk.
							<br><br>
							To avoid instances of this occuring, please use sharp and smaller needles.
							As it's been shown, blunt and higher gauge needles break rubber easier.
							For your convenience, I listed approved needles for injecting <a href="supplies.html">here in a guide.</a>
						</p>
						<h4>How to Store Vials</h4>
						<p>
							When it comes to storing vials, it's recommended to keep it in standard room temperature.
							Your testosterone vials <mark>can last 2 years</mark> by doing this.
							If you refigerate or store it in cold temperatures it may go through a process called Crystalization.
							If your testosterone has crystalized, it will likely be opaque or cloudy and contain small, needle-shaped crystals.
							This can cause pain when you inject, so simply <mark>store it in room temperature.</mark>

					<h3>What to Buy</h3>
					<div>
						<div class="CollIMG">
							<h4>Vial</h4>
							<img src="../assets/Vial.png">
						</div>
						<div class="CollIMG">
							<h4>Ampule</h4>
							<img src="../assets/Ampules.png">
						</div>
						<p>
							Only buy Testosterone with forumulations of <mark>Testosterone Cypionate</mark>> or <mark>Testosterone Enanthate.</mark>
							Make sure to only buy vials, no ampules.
							Avoid ampules because they're small glass vials you break off with your hand that are <mark>very inconvenient and messy to use.</mark>
							Not to mention, they're meant for one time usage.
							So you'd have to throw them away each time you use one. 
							<br><br>
							This is very important, if you accidentally buy anything else please join the Matrix server or email me.
							<br>
							If you're wondering now how to hide the vial and supplies from your parents, go here.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Where to Buy</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							To buy Testosterone you need to utilize steroid sites and bodybuilding forums.
							This is because Testosterone is an anabolic steroid commonly used and praticed as a performance enhancer.
							Therefore, it's commonly sold on steroid sites.
							<br><br>
							I listed internationally shipped testosterone vial sources down only.
							So regardless of your country, they should be able to ship to you.
							If you're planning to use a different source, you can email me if it's legit and you got the right thing.
							If you buy any Testosterone that aren't from these websites given below,
							please check the <a href="https://www.eroids.com/">Eroid source</a> reviews for that website.
							If none are present or bad reviews show up, be wise, don't buy.

			<!-- Calculate Dosages -->
			<div class="CollBody">
				<button type="button" class="Collapsible">How to Calculate Dosages</button>
				<div class="CollText">
					When you obtain a Testosterone vial, you will notice some text like <i>"250mg/ml"</i> or some text like <i>"2000ml/10ml"</i>
					<br>
					This shows the amount of <mark>>Testosterone (mg)</mark> within the <mark>total amount of oil (ml).</mark>
					So if you have a Testosterone vial that says <i>"250mg/ml"</i> that means for every milliliter there is 250 milligrams of Testosterone.
					Vials tend to have 10ml of liquid.
					So if you multiply 250mg by 10, in reality the total concentration is 2500mg/10ml in the entire vial.
					<br><br>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<div>
						So let's say you wanted to dose 50mg and you had a 250mg/ml vial of Testosterone.
						Divide 50mg by 250mg, you'll get 0.2ml as the amount of liquid you should draw up in your syringe to get 50mg.
						This singular vial can last you 50 weeks because 10ml divided by 0.2ml is 50.
						<br><br>
						Another example would be if you wanted to dose 25mg and you had a 200mg/ml vial of Testosterone.
						Divide 25mg by 200mg, and you'll get 0.125ml as the amount of liquid you should draw up in your syringe to get 25mg.
						This singular vial can last you 80 weeks because 10ml divided by 0.125ml is 80.
						<br><br>
						I know this is can be a rather new and confusing concept for some to grasp.
						So please join our Matrix server or contact us here to ask any questions.
