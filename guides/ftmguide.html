						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">Testosterone</a>
						is a sex hormone that's responsible for the <mark>maintenance and development of male characteristics,</mark> playing a key part in male puberty and male sexual reproduction.
						Some of the typical male characteristics it's known to promote are increased muscle/bone mass, deeper voice, body hair, facial hair and broader upper torso.
						This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virilization">Virilization</a> which is also better known as Masculinization.
						Though testosterone production occurs in both men and women alike, playing significant roles in our biology and health.
						Men just typically have more testosterone while women have less.
						<br><br>
						When someone has male ranges of Testosterone, they'll develop the male dimorphic features listed above.
						<mark>Beginning to look and sound like the other men</mark> they see within their family.
						You see the occurrence of this starting in a boy's puberty, he'll get taller and stronger.

					<p>
						When you do

						with Testosterone you can expect to develop these bodily effects below.
						A rough timelapse where you can expect these changes is provided, but of course this very much varies upon age and dosage.
						Please note that Testosterone's effectiveness is increased if you take it before or during your female puberty.
						After your female puberty is done, <mark>most of the bone-changing altercations will not occur.</mark>
						Height increase, bigger hands, Masculinization of the skull and bigger ribcage for example will not happen if you have finished female puberty (Tanner 5) and your bones have fused.

                        If you're questioning if you should do HRT, your first concern may be if it's dangerous.
                        <mark>Short answer, no.</mark>
                        <br><br>
						It's a widely used treatment and within
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy">testosterone replacement therapy (TRT),</a>
						men have found <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3897047/">several beneficial effects</a>
						because of how it can positively increase bone density, strength and energy level.
						So it's not dangerous but as with all medical procedures, there are risks.
						Though the chances of adverse effects actually occurring is extremely low.
						Especially if you manage your dosage wisely, go here for <a href="#RecDosage">recommended dosages.</a>
						<br><br>
                        <b>Once again, <mark>note the chances of adverse effects actually occurring is extremely low.</mark>

                        This does not mean HRT is unsafe, this means HRT has risks albeit minimal.</b>

						<h4>Overdose Risks</h4>
						<p>
							If you take too much testosterone, you may have chest pain, mood swings and/or unexplained weight gain.
							There are several other complications involved in the long-term usage of testosterone.
							If you experience any of these complications, you can attempt lowering your dosage.
							<br><br>
							Testosterone usage requires more care than estrogen usage so please
							<a href="/site/matrix.html">please join the matrix server</a>
							or <a href="/site/contacts.html">message me on Signal</a> for guidance. DIY safely!
						</p>

						<h4>Underdose Risks</h4>
						<p>
							Regardless of tanner stage or age.
                            If you take too little testosterone, you will not receive full masculinization effects and will continue going through female puberty.
							To prevent this from occurring, use the <a href="#RecDosage">recommended dosages.</a>

						This is a video from Dr. Meir Daller, here his assisting nurse is demonstrating how to do a thigh injection at home.
						If you happen to hit any veins or notice blood leaking out, just know it's perfectly fine.
						Simply apply pressure onto the injection site if this occurs.
					</p>

					<h3>Side Note from Author</h3>
					<p>
						When I first did my injection, I was nervous and afraid I'd do something wrong.
						I didn't put the entire needle in and some of the testosterone oil leaked out.
						After the more injections I did and as I gradually developed a routine, it all became something of great quick ease.
						I can now do my injections in <mark>less than 5 minutes without feeling pain.</mark>
						<br><br>
						So if you mess up the first one, it's fine.
						It's the fact that you're trying and the fact that you took such a large jump to get yourself the medical care you need.
						<mark>You'll improve and know that everything has been worth it</mark> once you notice yourself masculinizing.
					</p>

					<h3>Injection Supplies</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Injection supplies are <a href="supplies.html">listed here in this guide.</a>
							<mark>Please read the Injection Risks below</mark> and stick with buying the needles/syringes from the guide on this site.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Injection Risks</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							I'm using Trans Harm Reduction's guides and resources to relay the risks to wrongfully doing injections.
							There are a few risks to doing injections,
							although they are nothing to be worried about if you learn how to avoid them.
						</p>
						<h4>Vial Contamination/Coring</h4>
						<p>
							<a href="https://transharmreduction.org/vial-contamination">Vial Coring</a>
							is a form of <mark>Vial Contamination</mark> that occurs when the rubber seal on a vial is broken or damaged.
							The rubber seal's purpose is to stop contaminants from entering the oil.
							Coring can cause rubber from the seal to break off into the oil, posing a major safety risk.
							<br><br>
							To avoid instances of this occuring, please use sharp and smaller needles.
							As it's been shown, <a href="https://mesityl.substack.com/p/vial-coring-ampoule-shards-reusing">blunt and bigger needles break rubber easier.</a>
							For your convenience, I listed approved needles for injecting <a href="supplies.html">here in a guide.</a>
						</p>
						<h4>How to Store Vials</h4>
						<p>
							When it comes to storing vials, it's recommended to keep it in standard room temperature.
							Your testosterone vials <mark>can last 2 years</mark> by doing this.
							If you refigerate or store it in cold temperatures it may go through a
							<a href="https://themenshealthclinic.co.uk/why-does-testosterone-crystallise/">process called Crystalization.</a>
							If your testosterone has crystalized, it will likely be opaque or cloudy and contain small, needle-shaped crystals.
							This can cause pain when you inject, so simply <mark>store it in room temperature and do not refigerate.</mark>

					<h3>What to Buy</h3>
					<div>
						<div class="CollIMG">
							<h4>Vial</h4>
							<img src="../assets/Vial.png">
						</div>
						<div class="CollIMG">
							<h4>Ampule</h4>
							<img src="../assets/Ampules.png">
						</div>
						<p>
							Only buy Testosterone with forumulations of <mark>Testosterone Cypionate</mark> or <mark>Testosterone Enanthate.</mark>
							Make sure to only buy vials, no ampules.
							Avoid ampules because they're small glass vials you break off with your hand that are <mark>very inconvenient and messy to use.</mark>
							Not to mention, they're meant for one time usage.
							So you'd have to throw them away each time you use one. 
							<br><br>
							This is very important, if you accidentally buy anything else please join the 
							<a href="/site/matrix.html">Matrix server</a> or message me on<a href="/site/contacts.html">Signal</a>
							<br>
							If you're wondering now how to hide the vial and supplies from your parents, go here.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Where to Buy</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							To buy Testosterone you need to utilize steroid sites and bodybuilding forums.
							This is because Testosterone is an anabolic steroid commonly used and praticed as a performance enhancer.
							Therefore, it's commonly sold on steroid sites.
							<br><br>
							I listed internationally shipped testosterone vial sources down only.
							So regardless of your country, they should be able to ship to you.
							If you're planning to use a different source, you can message me on <a href="/site/contacts.html">Signal</a>
							if it's legit and you got the right thing.
							If you buy any Testosterone that aren't from these websites given below,
							please check the <a href="https://www.eroids.com/">Eroid source</a> reviews for that website.
							If none are present or bad reviews show up, be wise, don't buy.

                    <h3>Cryptocurrency Guide</h3>
					<p>
						The guide on how to purchase Bitcoin/Crypto is rather long,
						thus I decided to make a <a href ="/guides/cryptoguide.html">seperate page here.</a>

			<!-- Calculate Dosages -->
			<div class="CollBody" id="Dosage">
				<button type="button" class="Collapsible">How to Calculate Dosages</button>
				<div class="CollText">
					<p>
						When you obtain a Testosterone vial, you will notice some text like <i>"250mg/mL"</i> or some text like <i>"2000mg/10mL"</i>
						<br>
						This shows the amount of <mark>Testosterone (mg)</mark> within the <mark>total amount of oil (mL).</mark>
						So if you have a Testosterone vial that says <i>"250mg/mL"</i> that means for every milliliter there is 250 milligrams of Testosterone.
						Vials tend to have 10mL of liquid.
						So if you multiply 250mg by 10, in reality the total concentration is 2500mg/10mL in the entire vial.
						<br><br>
					</p>

					<h3>Examples</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							So let's say you wanted to dose 50mg and you had a 250mg/mL vial of Testosterone.
							Divide 50mg by 250mg, you'll get 0.2mL as the amount of liquid you should draw up in your syringe to get 50mg.
							This singular vial can last you 50 weeks because 10mL divided by 0.2mL is 50.
							<br><br>
							Another example would be if you wanted to dose 25mg and you had a 200mg/mL vial of Testosterone.
							Divide 25mg by 200mg, and you'll get 0.125mL as the amount of liquid you should draw up in your syringe to get 25mg.
							This singular vial can last you 80 weeks because 10mL divided by 0.125mL is 80.
							<br><br>
							I know this is can be a rather new and confusing concept for some to grasp.
							So please join our Matrix server or contact us here to ask any questions.

						In this segment I'll be discussing testosterone dosages respective to individuals' age.
						If you buy any other formulations of testosterone like Testosterone Propionate or even TestoGel,
						please <a href="/site/contacts.html">message me on Signal</a> or <a href="/site/matrix.html">join the Matrix Server</a> so I can provide guidance.
						<br><br>
						If you want to model the dosage for yourself, try <a href="https://steroidplotter.com/#">Steroid Plotter.</a>
						Note that your actual levels may be different,
						but it provides a decent enough graph for someone to get a better understanding of their levels.
						<br><br>
						<mark><b>Dosage Information</b></mark><br>
						I've based the following table primarily off of
						<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/center-for-transgender-health/documents/adolescentdosingguide41224.pdf">
							Johns Hopkins Dosing Guide for transgender adolescents.
						</a>
                        Before actually looking down and learning about your testosterone dosage,
                        I want to explain the differences between shorter regimen versus longer regimen.
                        <br><br>
                        Just know it's fine to do either shorter or longer, the only significant difference is stability.
                        When taking shorter regimens you'll achieve more stable levels albeit doing more frequent injections.
                        When taking longer regimens it's the opposite, but with the pro of doing less frequent injections.
                        I personally recommend doing the shorter regimens.

					<h3>11 Years Old and Under</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							There is no HRT dosage recommendation for transgender males for those 11 years old and younger.
							<br><br>
							<mark>I cannot safely guarantee</mark> any form of safe HRT administration within minors of this age range.
							Please do not pratice DIY HRT if you are 11 years old or under.
						</p>
						<h4>Pro-Trans Areas</h4>
						<p> 
							Contact your primary doctor about <mark>Puberty Blockers</mark> if you wish to <mark>stop future and present feminization</mark> and menstruation.
							This option is best recommended for those who live in transgender-tolerant countries or Democratic states.
						</p>
						<h4>Anti-Trans Areas</h4>
						<p>
							Contact your primary doctor about <mark>Depo-Provera</mark> if you wish to stop menstruation,
							this <mark>will not stop future and present feminization.</mark>
							This option is best recommended for those who live in anti-transgender countries or Republican states.
							<br><br>
							Please join our Matrix server to recieve HRT support, regardless if it's DIY or not.

					<h3>12 Years Old</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							The goal for hormonal treatment in 12 year-old transgender males is to <mark>induce male puberty</mark> since this is the average age for a male to begin his puberty.
							<br><br>
							The median Serum Testosterone amount for a 12 year old male is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0004563215610589">200 ng/dL.</a>
							To achieve this testosterone level the HRT dosage recommendation for 12 year old transgender males is as follows below.
							Be wary to not go above 100mg monthly as per the
							<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jes/article/5/1/bvaa161/5943483">Endocrine Soceity Adolescent TRT guidelines.</a>
