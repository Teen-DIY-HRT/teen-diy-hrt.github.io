						<p>This website was made primarily for teens and minors to practice transgender hormonal treatment at-home without medical supervision!
						<br><i>For adults, please use other DIY HRT guides such as the
						<a href="https://diyhrt.wiki/">DIY WIKI.</a></i></p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Only use this website if you have Gender Dysphoria. Hormonal replacement treatment is dedicated to treating medical conditions, it is not a tool for personal aesthetics. That being said, this website and the owner is not reliable if you regret the usage of your hormonal treatment. Please make wise and future-considerate choices regarding your HRT.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Per the Endocrine Society Guidelines on managing transgender hormone therapy, this site has a moral obligation to warn you the risks towards your fertility if HRT is used. The ability to reproduce can be negatively effected if a person uses hormonal treatment. Please research and keep your fertility in mind before making the decision to do hormonal treatment.
